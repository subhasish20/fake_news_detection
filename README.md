# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This repository presents a machine learning-based solution to detect **fake news** articles using natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms. The system can automatically distinguish between real and fake news content based on the textual patterns present in the data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

With the rise of digital media, the spread of misinformation has become a global challenge. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that:

- Automatically classifies news as **real** or **fake** based on its content.
- Uses advanced text preprocessing and vectorization techniques.
- Provides a scalable solution for content moderation, news agencies, or social media platforms.
- we can simply able to know the news is fake or not.
